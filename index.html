                        <p>A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.

Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying efficient. The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. Most databases use structured query language (SQL) for writing and querying data.</p>

                   <p>MySQL is one of the most recognizable technologies in the modern big data ecosystem. Often called the most popular database and currently enjoying widespread, effective use regardless of industry, it’s clear that anyone involved with enterprise data or general IT should at least aim for a basic familiarity of MySQL</p>

                        <h3>PLSQL</h3>
                       <p>PL/SQL stands for “Procedural Language extensions to the Structured Query Language”. SQL is a popular language for both querying and updating data in the relational database management systems (RDBMS). PL/SQL adds many procedural constructs to SQL language to overcome some limitations of SQL. Besides, PL/SQL provides a more comprehensive programming language solution for building mission-critical applications on Oracle Databases.</p>
